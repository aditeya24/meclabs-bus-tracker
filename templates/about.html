      <h1>About MecLabs Bus Tracker</h1>

      <p>
        MecLabs Bus Tracker is a project dedicated to improving the public
        transportation experience in Kerala by providing real-time bus
        information. We aim to empower commuters with accurate and timely data,
        reducing the stress and uncertainty often associated with bus travel. By
        leveraging technology and data, we strive to make public transport a
        more convenient, reliable, and attractive option for everyone.
      </p>

      <h2>The Problem We're Solving</h2>
      <p>
        Public bus travel in Kerala is often hampered by a lack of real-time
        information, leading to several key issues for passengers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Unknown Bus Locations:</strong> Not knowing the current
          location of a bus.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Unreliable Arrival Times:</strong> Inaccurate schedules making
          trip planning difficult.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Missed Buses:</strong> Lack of timely information leading to
          missed connections.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stressful Waits:</strong> Uncertainty about bus arrival times
          causing anxiety at bus stops.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Difficult Trip Planning:</strong> Challenges in planning
          journeys involving multiple buses.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Our Solution: Real-Time Bus Tracking</h2>
      <p>
        We're developing a user-friendly website that uses Google Maps APIs to
        provide real-time bus information. Our platform offers the following key
        features:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Real-Time Bus Tracking on a Map:</strong> View the current
          location of buses on an interactive map.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Accurate Estimated Arrival Times (ETAs):</strong> Dynamically
          updated ETAs based on real-time data and traffic conditions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Missed Bus Notifications:</strong> Alerts if you've likely
          missed your bus.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>"Next Bus" Information:</strong> Displaying the ETA of the
          next bus on your route.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Simplified Route Planning:</strong> Optimized bus route
          suggestions based on real-time data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bus Stop Details:</strong> Information about bus stops,
          including served routes and schedules.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Acquisition and Processing</h2>
      <p>We use two primary methods to gather real-time bus location data:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>GPS Tracking Devices (High Accuracy):</strong> Dedicated GPS
          units installed on buses for precise location updates.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mobile App (Cost-Effective):</strong> A simple app on drivers'
          or conductors' smartphones to share location data.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our backend system processes this data to calculate accurate ETAs and
        provide other real-time information.
      </p>

      <h2>Benefits for Commuters</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Empowered Commuters:</strong> Greater control over journeys
          with accurate information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Improved Time Management:</strong> Better planning and reduced
          waiting time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Increased Public Transport Usage:</strong> Making bus travel
          more convenient and attractive.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data-Driven Optimization:</strong> Providing data to improve
          bus services.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What We're Up To</h2>
      <div id="what-were-up-to"></div>
      <p>
        We are currently in the prototyping phase, building a web-based platform
        to demonstrate the core functionality of real-time bus tracking. Here's
        a look at our current progress and the technologies we're using:
      </p>

      <h3>Technology Stack</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Backend:</strong> A Flask application with Socket.IO for
          real-time communication. This handles location data processing and
          updates.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Frontend (Initial):</strong> Flask's `render_template`
          function is used to serve the initial website structure and integrate
          with the backend.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Map Visualization:</strong> OpenStreetMap and Leaflet are used
          to render the live location of buses on an interactive map.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Location Data Input:</strong> A separate "Send Location"
          webpage allows for real-time location updates to be sent to the
          backend. This data is temporarily stored on the server and distributed
          to the main website via Socket.IO.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Current Functionality</h3>
      <p>Our current prototype allows users to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>View the live location of all available buses on a map.</li>
        <li>See the route map of a selected bus.</li>
        <li>
          Receive live updates of bus locations and associated timestamps.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Planned Enhancements</h3>
      <p>
        We are planning to expand the functionality with the following features:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Database Integration:</strong> Implementing a database to
          store bus routes, schedules, and other persistent data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Predefined Routes:</strong> Defining and storing standard bus
          routes for improved route planning and display.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>User Authentication:</strong> Adding a login page for the
          "Send Location" section to verify the identity of the location data
          sender (e.g., drivers).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) Calculation:</strong>
          Implementing algorithms to estimate bus arrival times at various
          stops.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Missed Bus Detection:</strong> Developing logic to determine
          if a user has missed a bus based on real-time data.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Next Steps</h3>
      <p>Our immediate next steps are focused on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Implementing ETA Calculation:</strong> Developing and
          integrating the algorithms for estimating bus arrival times.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Improving Location Accuracy:</strong> Refining the data
          acquisition and processing methods to ensure more precise real-time
          location updates.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Implementing Predetermined Routes:</strong> Defining and
          storing standard bus routes within the system.
        </li>
      </ul>
